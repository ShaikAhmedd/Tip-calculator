# Tip-calculator
A tip calculator is a tool or application that helps users quickly determine the appropriate tip amount for a bill, typically at a restaurant, bar, or other service-based establishment. It calculates the tip based on a percentage of the total bill and can also split the total cost among multiple people if needed.
